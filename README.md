The place where I store the todo list, and changes to the server. Issue reports too.
I will slowly add more and more to this as time goes on. 
Usually has the updated skills and classes that the server is currently using.

Also home to a huge database of skills made in SkillApi. ~99% of them were made by me. 
You can take, and freely use, what you want! :D

If the skill was made by me, you can not claim they were made by you, nor can you sell them, that is not okay.
Obviously you can drastically change it to your liking, and then claim it is yours, as that would be fair use.
